# Local DevNet Smoke

The local DevNet smoke is an opt-in release check. It starts the
`cardano-node-clients` DevNet, verifies the node socket with network
magic `42`, records short-epoch timing evidence, and writes artifacts
under a fresh run directory.

This check is not part of `just ci`: it starts a real local
`cardano-node` and is meant as manual live evidence before a release.

## Prerequisites

Run it from the repository dev shell:

```bash
nix develop --quiet
```

The dev shell provides:

- `cardano-node` from the Cardano node flake input;
- `E2E_GENESIS_DIR`, pointing at the pinned
  `cardano-node-clients` DevNet genesis;
- the Cabal dependencies for `cardano-node-clients:devnet`.

## Node Boundary

```bash
just devnet-smoke node
```

Expected output:

```text
devnet-smoke: run-dir runs/devnet/YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ
devnet-smoke: network devnet magic 42
devnet-smoke: epoch-duration 50.0
devnet-smoke: socket /tmp/.../cardano-e2e/node.sock
devnet-smoke: phase node passed
```

The smoke writes:

```text
runs/devnet/YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ/
|-- node.log
|-- summary.json
|-- summary.log
`-- timing.json
```

`timing.json` records the pinned genesis values:

- `epochLength`: `500`
- `slotLengthSeconds`: `0.1`
- `epochDurationSeconds`: `50`
- `networkMagic`: `42`

## DevNet Experiment Order

The experiment is split into six tickets:

- [#82](https://github.com/lambdasistemi/amaru-treasury-tx/issues/82):
  governance action slice. This prepares and submits the local Conway
  treasury-withdrawal governance action that funds an Amaru script
  reward account.
- [#83](https://github.com/lambdasistemi/amaru-treasury-tx/issues/83):
  withdrawal slice. This consumes the funded reward account with
  `withdraw-wizard` and `tx-build`.
- [#86](https://github.com/lambdasistemi/amaru-treasury-tx/issues/86):
  disburse slice. This exercises `disburse-wizard` and `tx-build`
  against live treasury UTxOs, with USDM as the common operator path
  and ADA as an explicit covered variant.
- [#84](https://github.com/lambdasistemi/amaru-treasury-tx/issues/84):
  SundaeSwap V3 order build/funding slice. This brings the current
  swap path up to live DevNet evidence against the open-source
  SundaeSwap V3 order interface.
- [#85](https://github.com/lambdasistemi/amaru-treasury-tx/issues/85):
  SundaeSwap V3 order spend slice. This consumes the funded order
  under the real V3 contract rules on local DevNet.
- [#87](https://github.com/lambdasistemi/amaru-treasury-tx/issues/87):
  reorganize slice. This consolidates live treasury UTxOs once the
  release-facing reorganize builder from #46 exists.

The implemented phases today are `node` and `governance`.

`node` proves only the local node boundary, network magic, and timing.
`governance` currently reaches the explicit upstream-support boundary
and fails with `MISSING_UPSTREAM_GOVERNANCE_SUPPORT` until
`cardano-node-clients` exposes the Conway certificate, proposal, and
query capabilities tracked below. It is not yet proof that governance,
withdrawal, disburse, SundaeSwap order-build, SundaeSwap order-spend,
or reorganize transactions have been built or observed on DevNet.

SundaeSwap V3 contract compatibility should use the public V3 Aiken
contracts and SDK/reference material:

- [SundaeSwap V3 contracts](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/sundae-contracts)
- [SundaeSwap SDK](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/sundae-sdk)

A local toy swap validator is acceptable only as an explicitly named
fixture boundary. It is not SundaeSwap compatibility evidence.

## Governance Funding Model

The withdrawal path needs funds in the treasury script reward account.
On a local Conway DevNet, that means the setup must use protocol
treasury state and a treasury-withdrawal governance action targeting
the Amaru script stake credential.

A delegated key reward account is not accepted as Amaru withdrawal
evidence because the production withdrawal transaction uses the script
credential as the `Rewarding` witness. The governance setup must also
match the original Amaru registration shape: registration plus
always-abstain vote delegation.

Required upstream library support is tracked in:

- [cardano-node-clients#130](https://github.com/lambdasistemi/cardano-node-clients/issues/130)
- [cardano-node-clients#131](https://github.com/lambdasistemi/cardano-node-clients/issues/131)

## Failure Shape

The node phase fails before any treasury action if:

- `cardano-node` is not on `PATH`;
- `E2E_GENESIS_DIR` does not point at a
  `cardano-node-clients` genesis directory;
- the run directory already contains artifacts;
- the socket does not accept DevNet magic `42`;
- the effective epoch duration is not short enough for manual
  governance/reward testing.

The governance phase may fail with
`MISSING_UPSTREAM_GOVERNANCE_SUPPORT` while upstream support is still
open. That failure writes `governance/summary.json` and records the
blocking `cardano-node-clients` issues in `summary.log`.

Use the run directory's `node.log`, `summary.log`, `timing.json`, and
`governance/summary.json` when recording release evidence or
diagnosing failure.
