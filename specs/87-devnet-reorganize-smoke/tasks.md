## Slice S1 — reorganize phase scaffold + missing-builder guard

**Commit subject**: `feat(smoke): reorganize phase scaffold + MISSING_REORGANIZE_BUILDER guard`
**Tasks trailer**: `Tasks: T001, T002, T003, T004, T005`

- [X] **T001** — Recognize `reorganize` as a phase token in `scripts/smoke/smoke.sh` (`preflight_for_phase`, `main` `case "$phase"`, `print_help`).
- [X] **T002** — Add the boundary `MISSING_REORGANIZE_BUILDER` check (verify `amaru-treasury-tx reorganize-wizard --help` succeeds) before any DevNet bring-up; emit the diagnostic on the stderr trace and exit non-zero with a typed code documented in `spec.md`.
- [X] **T003** — Extend `app/devnet-cli-smoke-host/Main.hs` phase dispatch with a `reorganize` case that, for S1, only forwards to the smoke script and exits with whatever the smoke returned (no chain assertions yet).
- [X] **T004** — Extend `test/unit/Amaru/Treasury/Smoke/CliDevnetSmokeSpec.hs` with the new phase string in the allowed-phase list, plus a fixture-driven test that asserts the `MISSING_REORGANIZE_BUILDER` diagnostic is produced by a stub binary missing `reorganize-wizard` (shipped as the static-fixture A-001 binding form: source-level ordering + literal + phase allow-list assertions on `scripts/smoke/smoke.sh` and `app/devnet-cli-smoke-host/Main.hs`).
- [X] **T005** — Confirm `./gate.sh` runs green at HEAD; no `gate.sh` extension required if `just ci` already covers the new unit cases.

## Slice S2 — live reorganize phase body

**Commit subject**: `feat(smoke): live reorganize phase + asset preservation assertion`
**Tasks trailer**: `Tasks: T006, T007, T008, T009, T010, T011, T012`

- [X] **T006** — Implement `reorganize_phase` in `scripts/smoke/smoke.sh`: chain it after `disburse_phase`, inspect the `core_development` treasury UTxO set, perform an in-harness setup substep when the count is < 2, and surface `INSUFFICIENT_TREASURY_UTXOS` when setup cannot reach ≥2.
- [X] **T007** — Invoke the shipped `amaru-treasury-tx reorganize-wizard --network devnet …` runner to produce `<run-dir>/phases/reorganize/intent.json`; surface every typed `ReorganizeError` as a documented smoke diagnostic with the runner's exit code.
- [X] **T008** — Invoke the shipped `amaru-treasury-tx tx-build --intent <intent.json> --out <…>.unsigned.cbor`; record the build log under `<run-dir>/phases/reorganize/build.log`; surface `REORGANIZE_BUILD_FAILED` on non-zero exit.
- [X] **T009** — Write the per-phase `<run-dir>/phases/reorganize/summary.json` containing: selected input UTxOs (≥2), continuing-output value (including all native assets), epoch/tip context, asset preservation verdict (placeholder until T010 fills it), the intent and CBOR paths.
- [X] **T010** — In `app/devnet-cli-smoke-host/Main.hs`, add a `reorganize` chain-assertion path that decodes the unsigned CBOR, derives the input UTxO values via N2C `queryUTxO`, sums them across all asset classes, sums the continuing output's value across the same asset classes plus the fee (ledger conservation: inputs == outputs + fee), and writes the assertion verdict (and observed sums) into `summary.json`. Exits non-zero with `ASSET_PRESERVATION_FAILED` if value sums diverge on any axis.
- [X] **T011** — Extend `full_phase` to chain `reorganize_phase` after `disburse_phase`; extend the unified `summary.json` written by `write_full_summary` with a `reorganizeSummary` key. *(Note: `reorganize_phase` itself chains `disburse_phase`; the explicit `disburse_phase` line in `full_phase` is redundant and will be removed in S3 alongside the exec-units summary update — flagged by navigator, deferred.)*
- [X] **T012** — Extend `test/unit/Amaru/Treasury/Smoke/CliDevnetSmokeSpec.hs` with fixture-driven static cases that pin: phase body non-vacuity (wizard + tx-build invocations), `INSUFFICIENT_TREASURY_UTXOS` literal + UTxO query verb, `REORGANIZE_BUILD_FAILED` literal, run-dir artifact paths, `full_phase` chaining, `reorganizeSummary` key in `write_full_summary`, host `runReorganizeAssertionsIfPresent` dispatch, and `ASSET_PRESERVATION_FAILED` literal. Eight cases total, all PASS after GREEN.

## Slice S3 — exec-units assertion

**Commit subject**: `feat(smoke): assert reorganize exec units within pparams.maxTxExecutionUnits`
**Tasks trailer**: `Tasks: T013, T014, T015, T016`

- [X] **T013** — Smoke invokes `cardano-tx-tools tx-validate --input <…>.unsigned.cbor --n2c-socket-path "$CARDANO_NODE_SOCKET_PATH" --network-magic "$CLI_SMOKE_NETWORK_MAGIC" --output json` and captures the JSON output to `<run-dir>/phases/reorganize/tx-validate.json`. Non-zero exit funnelled through the host's parse path so `EXEC_UNITS_VALIDATOR_UNAVAILABLE` always fires (rather than being silently swallowed).
- [X] **T014** — Host parses the captured `tx-validate.json`, loads `pparams.maxTxExecutionUnits.{memory,steps}` from the live node via `queryProtocolParamsH` + `ppMaxTxExUnitsL` (no hard-coded constant), sums redeemer exec units across ALL redeemers via `sumExUnits` with a `perRedeemer` breakdown, asserts on both memory AND steps axes, and writes `execUnitsVerdict` (status: within-limits | over-limit | unavailable, with observed / limit / per-redeemer) into `summary.json`. Three `EXEC_UNITS_VALIDATOR_UNAVAILABLE` branches (missing file / unparseable JSON / schema mismatch); `EXEC_UNITS_OVER_LIMIT` fires on either axis exceed.
- [X] **T015** — `CliDevnetSmokeSpec.hs` extended with 8 fixture-driven cases pinning `tx-validate` flag binding, run-dir output path, `EXEC_UNITS_OVER_LIMIT` / `EXEC_UNITS_VALIDATOR_UNAVAILABLE` literals, `execUnitsVerdict` key, `queryProtocolParamsH` + `maxTxExecutionUnits` references, `full_phase` ordering (reorganize before disburse, with disburse removed), `write_full_summary` surfacing `execUnitsVerdict` via `--slurpfile`.
- [X] **T016** — Live-boundary leg run by the orchestrator. `just devnet-cli-smoke --phase reorganize --run-dir runs/devnet-cli/87-t016-orchestrator-followup` against a fresh local DevNet (via `nix develop`). **Evidence captured**: (a) smoke wires the full chain (registry-stake → governance → disburse → reorganize); (b) `treasury-inspect` correctly counts 3 UTxOs at `core_development` (201_000_000 lovelace total); (c) `reorganize-wizard --network devnet` produces a valid-shape `intent.json` referencing the 3 treasury UTxOs and the funding wallet UTxO; (d) `tx-build --intent` is invoked and fires the typed `REORGANIZE_BUILD_FAILED` diagnostic when the upstream Plutus phase-2 validation rejects the rewarding redeemer of the permissions script (CekError, script hash `17e03cc22e4f0fb441d84c51125ddf39e857d168f3d4760444058f74`); (e) jq filter bug in `treasury-inspect` parsing surfaced and fixed under [S3b](#slice-s3b--fix-treasuryutxos-jq-path-live-boundary-regression). **Upstream blocker for happy-path completion**: [#212](https://github.com/lambdasistemi/amaru-treasury-tx/issues/212) (reorganize Plutus phase-2 validation failure on permissions rewarding redeemer). The smoke harness is feature-complete; happy-path `assetPreservationVerdict` / `execUnitsVerdict` evidence requires #212 to resolve.

## Slice S3b — fix treasuryUtxos jq path (live-boundary regression)

**Surfaced by T016**: live-boundary leg `just devnet-cli-smoke --phase reorganize` showed the chain DID have 3 `treasuryUtxos` at `core_development` after the disburse + seed-split chain ran, but the smoke's jq filter (`'[.. | objects | select(has("utxos")) | .utxos[]?] | length'`) keyed on `"utxos"` instead of `"treasuryUtxos"` (the actual key in the `amaru-treasury-tx treasury-inspect --format json` output). Smoke read 0 and fired `INSUFFICIENT_TREASURY_UTXOS` on the happy path. Unit suite missed it because the static fixtures pin the literal diagnostic and the helper name, not the jq path.

**Commit subject**: `fix(smoke): key reorganize treasury-utxo count on treasuryUtxos`
**Tasks trailer**: `Tasks: T019, T020`

- [X] **T019** — In `scripts/smoke/smoke.sh`'s `reorganize_phase`, fix both jq filters (the primary count and the post-setup retry count) so they key on `.treasuryUtxos` filtered by `.scope == "core_development"`.
- [X] **T020** — In `test/unit/Amaru/Treasury/Smoke/CliDevnetSmokeSpec.hs`, add a fixture-driven regression that pins the `.treasuryUtxos` jq key inside the `reorganize_phase` body and asserts the absent wrong key `.utxos[]?]`.

## Slice S4 — finalization (orchestrator-owned)

**Commit subject**: `chore: drop gate.sh (ready for review)`
**Tasks trailer**: n/a (chore commits skip the Tasks: trailer per the commit-message gate).

- [X] **T017** — `git rm gate.sh`; commit; finalization audit run by the orchestrator (Conventional Commits + Tasks trailer over every commit on the branch); `gh pr ready`.
- [X] **T018** — PR body updated with: live-boundary T016 evidence, all S1–S3 + S3b commit references, the five delivered diagnostics (`MISSING_REORGANIZE_BUILDER`, `INSUFFICIENT_TREASURY_UTXOS`, `REORGANIZE_BUILD_FAILED`, `ASSET_PRESERVATION_FAILED`, `EXEC_UNITS_OVER_LIMIT` / `EXEC_UNITS_VALIDATOR_UNAVAILABLE`), the run-dir layout, the upstream #212 blocker for happy-path completion, and explicit non-claims for #188 (operator docs + asciinema cast) and #46 (operator surface closure).

## Out of scope (named, not deferred to invent later)

- Operator docs / asciinema cast — #188.
- Closing #46 — the feature anchor closes against the slice that ships the operator surface; #87 does not change the operator surface.
- Mainnet/preprod submission.
- Refactoring `disburse_phase`, `governance_phase`, or the host's existing chain-assertion glue.
